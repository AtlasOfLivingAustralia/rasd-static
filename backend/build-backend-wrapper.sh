#!/bin/bash

##
# This script runs build-backend.sh in a docker container.
# Can also be used to run build-backend.sh in the local terminal environment. See usage
#
# Reasons
#   a) consistent python environment
#   b) consistent version of poetry, also avoid installing pipx and poetry locally (for non backend devs)
#   c) The above also apply for the Gitlab runner environment
#   d) Having a local script to do this helps in development and debugging of the CI job
#   e) The work is reusable as the script of the CI job
#      i.e. `cd ./backend && build-backend-docker.sh local` instead of writing lines of code
#
# EXAMPLE USAGE
#   bash build-backend-docker.sh --help
#   LAMBDA_NAME=rasd_fastapi bash build-backend-docker.sh docker
#   LAMBDA_NAME=rasd_fastapi bash build-backend-docker.sh local

# Exit on any errors. Can sometimes cause unexpected exits.
# Detect errors in child scripts we call from this one, instead of continuing blindly. Helps in debugging.
# e.g. if not set, script will not stop on this error: build-backend.sh: line 6: 1: Please provide the name of the lambda on $1! e.g. rasd-fastapi
