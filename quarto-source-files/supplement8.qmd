## Example scenarios

A data custodian may wish to embargo either an entire dataset or a subset of records within a dataset for a variety of reasons. These may include, but are not limited to:

-   Embargoing data for a specified period which identify a previously unknown population of a species or a previously undescribed species prior to the data custodian publishing a paper documenting these new findings

-   Embargoing data that are commercial-in-confidence prior to the end of legal contract to develop an area of land

-   Embargoing data which was part of a research project prior to researchers exclusively being able to analyse and publish their results/ findings

-   Embargoing attributes in a dataset that may contain information on the dates and locations of questionably obtained specimens for collections e.g. items acquired from a deceased estate

-   Embargoing data on species which may impact on trade e.g. for a period of 10 years

-   Embargoing data on species which are undergoing assessment for threatened species listing
